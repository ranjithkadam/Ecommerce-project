🛒 E-Commerce Website (Frontend Project):

A responsive and user-friendly E-Commerce Website built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript (ES6).
This project demonstrates core front-end concepts such as fetching product data from an API, category-based filtering, and add-to-cart functionality, providing a smooth and interactive shopping experience.

📌 Project Overview:
The E-Commerce Website is a front-end web application designed to showcase products across multiple categories such as Men’s Clothing, Women’s Clothing, Jewelry, and Electronics.
Products are dynamically fetched from an external API and rendered on the UI. Users can browse products, filter them by category, and add selected items to the cart. The cart automatically updates item count, quantity, and total price.
This project focuses on strengthening practical knowledge of JavaScript DOM manipulation, API integration, and responsive UI development.

✨ Features:
🔄 Fetches product and cart data from an external API
🗂 Category-based product filtering
🛒 Add to Cart functionality
➕➖ Increase and decrease product quantity in cart
🧾 Dynamic order summary with total calculation
📱 Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
🎨 Clean and modern UI using Tailwind CSS

🛠 Technologies Used:
HTML5
Tailwind CSS
JavaScript (ES6)
Fetch API

⚙️ How It Works:
Fetching Data from API:
JavaScript fetch() is used to retrieve product data.
Data is converted into JSON and dynamically displayed as product cards.

Filtering Products:
Category buttons allow users to view products based on selected categories.
Filtering is handled using JavaScript array methods.

Add to Cart:
Clicking "Add to Cart" stores product details in a cart array.
Cart count updates in the navbar.
Cart page displays selected products with quantity and price.

Cart Calculations:
Total price updates automatically when quantity changes.
Shipping and final total are calculated dynamically.
